# Styling & Theming

### Theme
Refers to App-Wide styling. It is implemented through CSS Variables. CSS variables are
like Sass variables, but even better, because you can change them at runtime.  
Through css variables you can also change app wide settings such as attributes settings and grids.

### Custom CSS
As in any Angular app, you can use custom css rules to apply and override more specific (i.e. component level)
styles.
