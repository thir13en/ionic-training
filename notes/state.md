# State

The teacher distinguishes three different types of state.

1. UI state: the ui changes reacting to what is happening (loading, event...)
It is normally managed inside Components.
1. Temporary/local state: normally stored in services, this is data that is retrieved
and manipulated in the app.
1. Persistent state: managed on a backend/database, normally decoupled from the app.
